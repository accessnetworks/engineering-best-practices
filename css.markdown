# Philosophy

Our websites are built mobile first, using performant CSS. Well-structured CSS yields maintainability and better collaboration which ultimately yields better client experiences.

# Accessibility

## Animation

Not every animation brings pleasure to the end user. In some cases motion can trigger harmful reactions from users with vestibular disorders, epilepsy or even migraines.

The prefer-reduced-motion CSS media feature does not currently have the widest support, but is active in Safari and Firefox). However, we still recommend applying it, as it is simple to implement and affords a better experience for those using supported browsers.
